Abstract:
          By using Deep Learning, this paper is all about testing a vehicle with the help of machine. Commercial or not, every single vehicle must periodically 
	  endure fitness test in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 2018 section 124(1)(th), based on the age of the vehicle. All vehicles must be presented
	  to fitness facilities for inspection and certification. Additionally, there are very few centres in each district, so it is obvious to face a huge queue
	  and hassels to get the service. Specially, in regional offices, there are only one mechanic to supervise whereas the 54 central offices ran under BRTA 
	  provides at most 4-5 mechanic.
